- Backend: Supabase serverless only ‚úÖ
- Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase only ‚úÖ

**Business Logic Needs:**
1. **Product Management**
   - Dynamic product CRUD operations
   - Inventory tracking
   - Product categories and variants
   - Image upload and management

2. **Customer Inquiries**

- Shadcn/ui components
- Responsive design

### Backend: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- No database currently
- No API endpoints
- No data persistence
- Static content only

## Alternative Solutions Analysis

### Option 1: Buildify-Compatible Stack (RECOMMENDED)
**Tech Stack:** React + Supabase + PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ Fully supported by Buildify
- ‚úÖ Serverless backend (no server management)
- ‚úÖ Real-time capabilities
- ‚úÖ Built-in authentication
- ‚úÖ Edge functions for custom logic
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL (more powerful than MongoDB for business logic)

### Option 2: User's Preferred Stack (NOT SUPPORTED)
**Tech Stack:** React + Node.js + MongoDB
- ‚ùå Node.js backend not supported by Buildify
- ‚ùå MongoDB not supported by Buildify
- ‚ùå Requires separate server hosting
- ‚ùå More complex deployment and maintenance

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (PARTIAL SUPPORT)
**Tech Stack:** React + External Node.js API + MongoDB
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend integration possible
- ‚ùå Backend development not supported
- ‚ùå User would need to develop Node.js API separately
- ‚ùå Complex integration and maintenance
